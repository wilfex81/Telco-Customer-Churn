# Customer Churn Analysis (Excel)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn to identify key factors influencing customer retention. Using Excel pivot tables and visualizations, it determines who churns, why they churn, and which factors matter most for business decisions.

## Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard provides a high-level view of customer churn patterns, highlighting the most influential factors affecting customer retention. It shows that churn is primarily driven by contract type, with month-to-month customers exhibiting significantly higher churn rates compared to customers on longer-term contracts.

Additional segmentation confirms that demographic factors such as gender have minimal impact on churn, allowing focus to remain on behavioral and contractual drivers. The dashboard is designed to support fast, data-driven decisions by clearly identifying high-risk customer groups and areas where retention efforts will have the greatest impact.



## Dataset

**Source:** Telecom Customer Churn dataset

**Contents:**
- Customer ID
- Churn status (Yes/No)
- Contract type
- Tenure
- Monthly and total charges
- Demographics (gender)
- Services subscribed

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Calculated percentages (% of Row Total)
- Column charts
- Dashboard-style visual summaries

## Key Findings

| Factor | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| **Overall Churn Rate** | 26.54% |
| **Contract Type** | Month-to-month: 42.7% \| One-year: 11.3% \| Two-year: 2.8% |
| **Gender** | Female: 26.92% \| Male: 26.16% (not a meaningful driver) |

## Key Insights

1. **Contract Type is the Strongest Driver** – Longer contracts dramatically reduce churn
2. **Gender Has No Impact** – Churn rates are nearly identical across genders
3. **Actionable Focus** – Prioritize month-to-month to longer-term contract migration

## Business Recommendations

- Focus retention efforts on month-to-month customers
- Encourage migration to longer-term contracts
- Avoid demographic-based churn strategies
- Prioritize variables with measurable behavioral influence

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates a structured, hypothesis-driven approach emphasizing signal over noise to deliver clear, decision-focused insights for business environments.
